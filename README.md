# Team Project


## **Summary of Application:**
- Our application is a game platform for users to create accounts and track their points in comparison to other players in 3 games: Block Blast, Wordle, and Chess Puzzles.
- The application starts with a login screen where users are able to make a new account or login into their pre-existing account.
- They will have all 3 games available to play with unlimited attempts, with a leaderboard of the high scores of all users
